# Starbucks_Capstone_Challenge

## 1. Motivation
It's a capstone project of the data scientist course in Udacity. The data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behaviour on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. I want to answer two questions through data analysis.
1. who are responsive to coffee offers?
2. How much someone will spend based on demographics and offer types?

## 3. Ssummary of the results of the analysis
Visualization and Linear regression are used in the analysis and get the conclusion:
> Advertising can help increase revenues but not profits necessarily. Informational offer has more negligible effect than BOGO and discount. However, if Starbucks intend to attract more consumers, promotion costs might offset incomes while there is not enough customer response.
> Due to the low response rate, it suggests that advertising higher income females who are three years member seem a good idea since they are most likely spending more in Starbucks.
